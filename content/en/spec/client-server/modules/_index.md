Modules are parts of the Client-Server API which are not universal to
all endpoints. Modules are strictly defined within this specification
and should not be mistaken for experimental extensions or optional
features. A compliant server implementation MUST support all modules and
supporting specification (unless the implementation only targets clients
of certain profiles, in which case only the required modules for those
feature profiles MUST be implemented). A compliant client implementation
MUST support all the required modules and supporting specification for
the [Feature Profile](#feature-profiles) it targets.
