Clients may want to receive push notifications when events are received at
the homeserver. This is managed by a distinct entity called the Push Gateway.

Overview
--------

A client's homeserver forwards information about received events to the push
gateway. The gateway then submits a push notification to the push notification
provider (e.g. APNS, GCM).

Homeserver behaviour
--------------------

This describes the format used by "HTTP" pushers to send notifications of
events to Push Gateways. If the endpoint returns an HTTP error code, the
homeserver SHOULD retry for a reasonable amount of time using exponential backoff.

When pushing notifications for events, the homeserver is expected to include all of
the event-related fields in the ``/notify`` request. When the homeserver is performing
a push where the ``format`` is ``"event_id_only"``, only the ``event_id``, ``room_id``,
``counts``, and ``devices`` are required to be populated.

Note that most of the values and behaviour of this endpoint is described by the Client-Server
API's `Push Module <../client_server/%CLIENT_RELEASE_LABEL%.html#module-push>`_.
