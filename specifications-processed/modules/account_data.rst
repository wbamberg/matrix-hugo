Client Config
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _module:account_data:

Clients can store custom config data for their account on their homeserver.
This account data will be synced between different devices and can persist
across installations on a particular device. Users may only view the account
data for their own account

The account_data may be either global or scoped to a particular rooms.

Events
++++++

The client receives the account data as events in the ``account_data`` sections
of a ``/sync``.

These events can also be received in a ``/events`` response or in the
``account_data`` section of a room in ``/sync``. ``m.tag``
events appearing in ``/events`` will have a ``room_id`` with the room
the tags are for.

Client Behaviour
++++++++++++++++

Server Behaviour
++++++++++++++++

Servers MUST reject clients from setting account data for event types that
the server manages. Currently, this only includes `m.fully_read`_.
