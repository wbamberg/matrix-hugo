Guest access
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _module:guest-access:

It may be desirable to allow users without a fully registered user account to
ephemerally access Matrix rooms. This module specifies limited ways of doing so.

Note that this is not currently a complete anonymous access solution; in
particular, it only allows servers to provided anonymous access to rooms in
which they are already participating, and relies on individual homeservers to
adhere to the conventions which this module sets, rather than allowing all
participating homeservers to enforce them.

Events
++++++

{{m_room_guest_accessibility}}

Client behaviour
++++++++++++++++
A client can register for guest access using the FOO endpoint. From that point
on, they can interact with a limited subset of the existing client-server API,
as if they were a fully registered user, using the access token granted to them
by the server.

These users are only allowed to make calls in relation to rooms which have the
``m.room.history_visibility`` event set to ``world_readable``.

The APIs they are allowed to hit are:

/rooms/{roomId}/messages
/rooms/{roomId}/state
/rooms/{roomId}/state/{eventType}/{stateKey}
/events

Server behaviour
++++++++++++++++
Does the server need to handle any of the new events in a special way (e.g.
typing timeouts, presence). Advice on how to persist events and/or requests are
recommended to aid implementation. Federation-specific logic should be included
here.

Security considerations
+++++++++++++++++++++++
This includes privacy leaks: for example leaking presence info. How do
misbehaving clients or servers impact this module? This section should always be
included, if only to say "we've thought about it but there isn't anything to do
here".
