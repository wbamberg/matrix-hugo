Ignoring Users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. _module:ignore_users:

With all the communication through Matrix it may be desirable to ignore a
particular user for whatever reason. This module defines how clients and 
servers can implement the ignoring of users.

Events
++++++

{{m_ignored_user_list_event}}

Client behaviour
++++++++++++++++
To ignore a user, effectively blocking them, the client should add the target
user to the ``m.ignored_user_list`` event in their account data using 
|/user/<user_id>/account_data/<type>|_. Once ignored, the client will no longer 
receive events sent by that user, with the exception of state events. The client 
should either hide previous content sent by the newly ignored user or perform 
a new ``/sync`` with no previous token.

Invites to new rooms by ignored users will not be sent to the client. The server
may optionally reject the invite on behalf of the client.

State events will still be sent to the client, even if the user is ignored. 
This is to ensure parts, such as the room name, do not appear different to the
user just because they ignored the sender. 

To remove a user from the ignored users list, remove them from the account data
event. The server will resume sending events from the previously ignored user,
however it should not send events that were missed while the user was ignored.
To receive the events that were sent while the user was ignored the client 
should perform a fresh sync. The client may also un-hide any events it previously
hid due to the user becoming ignored.

Server behaviour
++++++++++++++++
Following an update of the ``m.ignored_user_list``, the sync API for all clients
should immediately start ignoring (or un-ignoring) the user. Clients are responsible
for determining if they should hide previously sent events or to start a new sync
stream.

Servers must still send state events sent by ignored users to clients.

Servers must not send room invites from ignored users to clients. Servers may
optionally decide to reject the invite, however.
