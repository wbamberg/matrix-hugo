It also specifies the levels of each user in the room.\n\nIf a ``user_id`` is in the ``users`` list, then that ``user_id`` has the\nassociated power level. Otherwise they have the default level\n``users_default``. If ``users_default`` is not supplied, it is assumed to be\n0. If the room contains no ``m.room.power_levels`` event, the room's creator has\na power level of 100, and all other users have a power level of 0.\n\nThe level required to send a certain event is governed by ``events``,\n``state_default`` and ``events_default``. If an event type is specified in\n``events``, then the user must have at least the level specified in order to\nsend that event. If the event type is not supplied, it defaults to\n``events_default`` for Message Events and ``state_default`` for State\nEvents.\n\nIf there is no ``state_default`` in the ``m.room.power_levels`` event, the\n``state_default`` is 50. If there is no ``events_default`` in the\n``m.room.power_levels`` event, the ``events_default`` is 0. If the room\ncontains no ``m.room.power_levels`` event, *both* the ``state_default`` and\n``events_default`` are 0.\n\nThe power level required to invite a user to the room, kick a user from the\nroom, ban a user from the room, or redact an event, is defined by ``invite``,\n``kick``, ``ban``, and ``redact``, respectively. Each of these levels defaults\nto 50 if they are not specified in the ``m.room.power_levels`` event, or if\nthe room contains no ``m.room.power_levels`` event.\n\n.. NOTE::\n\n  As noted above, in the absence of an ``m.room.power_levels`` event, the\n  ``state_default`` is 0, and all users are considered to have power level 0.\n  That means that **any** member of the room can send an\n  ``m.room.power_levels`` event, changing the permissions in the room.\n\n  Server implementations should therefore ensure that each room has an\n  ``m.room.power_levels`` event as soon as it is created.
